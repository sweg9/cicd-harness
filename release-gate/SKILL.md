# Release gate

Combines the other skills of this repo. Requirements: https://sweg9.github.io/docs/product/requirements.

## Steps

Run in this order and record each result before the next step.

1. `check-conformance` on the diff. **Blocker:** any violation of C-04, C-05 or C-10.
2. `validate-dataset` if labels changed. **Blocker:** "not ready".
3. `check-fr-coverage`. **Blocker:** a requirement touched by the change with no test.
4. `check-execution-log` on the latest run logs, then `run-stage-eval`. **Blocker:** a target in `eval-targets` fails, or a stage success rate drops below the last accepted run by more than the allowed drop in settings. Measures without data are "not measured", not passed.
5. `prompt-regression` if a prompt file changed. **Blocker:** verdict "reject".
6. `build-sim-demo` if `sim-demo` changed. **Blocker:** the build fails.

## Verdict

- **go**: no blocker and nothing "not measured" among the checks the change needs.
- **go with notes**: no blocker, but some checks are "not measured" or "low sample". List them.
- **no-go**: at least one blocker.

## Output

A table of step, result and blocker, then the verdict in one line and the shortest list of what must change. Do not merge, tag or publish anything. Say what was not run and why.
